# Linear Regression Comparison: Custom Gradient Descent vs Sklearn

This project compares the performance of a custom implementation of linear regression using gradient descent with the built-in `LinearRegression` model from the `sklearn` library.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/boogen/ml-course.git
  cd ml-course/linear_regression
  ```


2. Install dependencies in a virtual environment
  ```bash
  python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate
  pip3 install -r requirements.txt
  ```
  
3. Run the script:
  ```bash
  python3 model.py
  ```

## 📈 Result

Loss of the custom model: **0.5309**
Loss of the Sklearn model: **0.5243**
