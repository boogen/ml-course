# KNN Classifier Implementation

This repository contains an implementation of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier from scratch, using the Iris dataset. The project includes both a custom KNN implementation and a comparison with the popular Scikit-learn KNN implementation.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/boogen/ml-course.git
  cd ml-course/knn
  ```


2. Install dependencies in a virtual environment
  ```bash
  python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate
  pip3 install -r requirements.txt
  ```
  
3. Run the script:
  ```bash
  python3 model.py
  ```
